<h1> The sun </h1>
<p>Our Sun formed about 4.5 billion years ago.The Sun can be divided in six layers.The corona,chromosphere,photosphere,convective zone,radiative zone and the core.In the core 
temperatures reach at least 27 million degres fahrenheit. Our Sun is the largest and most massive object in the Solar System.It can fit all planets inside nearly 600 times.</P>
<p>Without the sun's gravity,these celestionl bodies would drift off into deep space.The Sun is a giant / big star and magnet.The sun will not live forever,in 6.5 billion years it
will run out of its hydrogen fuel.It will expand to envelop Mercury,Venus and even Earth and then collapse into a small star know as a white  dwarf.</p>
